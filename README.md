# Grok plugin for Claude Code

Use Grok from inside Claude Code for code reviews or to delegate tasks to Grok.

This plugin is for Claude Code users who want to use the local `grok` CLI from the workflow they already have.

## What You Get

- `/grok:review` for a read-only Grok review of your current changes or branch diff
- `/grok:rescue` to delegate a focused coding task to Grok through the `grok:grok-rescue` subagent

## Requirements

- **Grok CLI installed and signed in**
- **Node.js 18.18 or later**

## Install

Install the Grok CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your shell if needed, then verify that `grok` is available:

```bash
grok --version
```

Sign in to Grok:

```bash
grok login
```

Add the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add blockchainian/grok-plugin-cc
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install grok@blockchainian
```

Reload plugins:

```bash
/reload-plugins
```

After install, you should see:

- `/grok:review` and `/grok:rescue` in slash command autocomplete
- the `grok:grok-rescue` subagent in `/agents`

One simple first run is:

```bash
/grok:review
```

If your working tree has no changes, it should report that there are no changes to review.

## Usage

### `/grok:review`

Runs a read-only Grok review on your current work.

Use it when you want:

- a review of your current uncommitted changes
- a review of your branch compared to a base branch like `main`
- a review focused on a specific risk area

Use `--base <ref>` for branch review. Any text after the flags is passed to Grok as reviewer focus.

Examples:

```bash
/grok:review
/grok:review --base main
/grok:review --base main focus on security and data loss risks
/grok:review focus on missing tests
```

This command gathers git status and diff context locally, then invokes the local `grok` CLI with a temporary prompt file. It asks Grok not to edit files and disables Grok tools for the review run.

### `/grok:rescue`

Hands a task to Grok through the `grok:grok-rescue` subagent.

Use it when you want Grok to:

- investigate a bug
- try a focused fix
- take a second pass on a failing test or implementation detail
- report what files it changed and what verification it ran

Examples:

```bash
/grok:rescue investigate why the tests started failing
/grok:rescue fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch
/grok:rescue review the auth helper and suggest a safer implementation
```

The subagent uses your local `grok` CLI. If Grok is unavailable or not signed in, it reports the exact error.

## Typical Flows

### Review Before Shipping

```bash
/grok:review --base main
```

### Hand A Problem To Grok

```bash
/grok:rescue investigate why the build is failing
```

## Grok Integration

This plugin uses the global `grok` binary installed in your environment.

That means:

- it uses the same Grok install you would use directly
- it uses the same local Grok authentication state
- it runs from the same repository checkout and machine-local environment
- it does not install Grok for you
- it does not manage Claude Code configuration after the plugin is installed

For Grok CLI help and configuration options, run:

```bash
grok --help
```

## Local Development

From this repository, validate the plugin without installing it:

```bash
npm test
claude plugin validate --strict .
claude plugin validate --strict plugins/grok
```

Load the plugin for one Claude Code session without changing installed plugins:

```bash
claude --no-session-persistence --plugin-dir plugins/grok
```

For a non-interactive smoke test:

```bash
claude --no-session-persistence --plugin-dir plugins/grok -p "Say ok" --tools ""
```

## FAQ

### Is `blockchainian/grok-plugin-cc` a GitHub repository?

Yes. `claude plugin marketplace add` accepts a URL, local path, or GitHub repository source. The `owner/repo` form follows the GitHub organization or username and repository name, so this plugin uses:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add blockchainian/grok-plugin-cc
```

### Why is the install command `grok@blockchainian`?

`grok` is the plugin name. `blockchainian` is the marketplace name declared by this repository.

Claude Code uses `plugin@marketplace` when installing a plugin from a specific marketplace.

### Do I need a separate Grok account for this plugin?

You need whatever account or authentication method your local `grok` CLI requires. If `grok` works in your terminal, the plugin should use the same local authentication.

### Does the plugin use a separate Grok runtime?

No. It delegates through your local `grok` CLI on the same machine.

### Can I test the plugin without installing it?

Yes. Use `--plugin-dir plugins/grok` from this checkout as shown in [Local Development](#local-development).
